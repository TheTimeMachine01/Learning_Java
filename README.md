## Getting Started

Welcome to My Java Learning Progress 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `.idea` : the folder containing the IntelliJ Configurations

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

> I also set up this Project with IntelliJ Idea IDE. You can Download IntelliJ From [Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) 

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
